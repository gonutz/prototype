# Font Generation

This library uses the [open source Go font
`Go-Mono.ttf`](https://go.dev/blog/go-fonts) for text rendering. The WASM port
embeds the TTF font file directly. For desktop, we use a bitmap font atlas which
is generated by the C program in this folder.

`main.c` uses [`stb_truetype.h` and
`stb_imwrite.h`](https://github.com/nothings/stb) to generate a black and white
font PNG file. This file (`font.png`) is saved to this folder.

`make_font_transparent.go` takes the generated PNG file and replaces the back
background with transparency. This file is saved to `../font.png` and the
desktop versions of this library will embed that file.
